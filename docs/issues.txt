CANARD MODERNIZATION - KNOWN ISSUES & VERIFICATION LOG
Version: 1.4 (Integration Phase)

1. JAVASCRIPT: REDUNDANT INIT LOGIC
Issue: Some scripts (like navigation.js) contain their own DOMContentLoaded listeners while also being enqueued with the 'true' footer flag in functions.php.
Impact: Negligible performance hit, but causes double-initialization checks.
Status: Monitoring; may consolidate into a single init.js if needed.

2. CSS: SPACING VARIABLE FALLBACKS
Issue: posts.js relies on --wp--preset--spacing--lg and --md. If theme.json is edited and these slugs are renamed, the layout defaults to hardcoded 60/30px.
Impact: Potential minor visual inconsistency if design tokens are changed without updating JS.
Status: Documented in posts.js comments.

3. PERFORMANCE: JQUERY DEPENDENCIES
Issue: While core theme scripts are vanilla, third-party plugins (like Jetpack or Contact Form 7) may re-enqueue jQuery.
Impact: Prevents a 100% "jQuery-free" environment in some configurations.
Status: functions.php currently only deregisters jQuery for non-logged-in users to avoid breaking the Admin Bar.

4. PHP 8.4: TYPE COERCION IN ARCHIVES
Issue: Archive title logic in legacy inc/template-tags.php may still pass mixed types to return strings.
Impact: Potential TypeError under strict_types.
Status: High priority for the next refactor phase.
